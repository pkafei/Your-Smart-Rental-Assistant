ðŸš€ **What This Is:**  
This is a **local LLM** that answers renter questions based on the data it's given. No cloud dependencies, no waiting on third-party APIsâ€”just **instant answers** from a custom-trained model.  

ðŸŽ¯ **The Problem It Solves:**  
Property managers waste hours answering the same questions. Renters get stuck digging through pages of rules, instructions, and documents. This fixes that.  

- **More Time for Property Managers** â†’ Focus on high-leverage tasks.  
- **Better User Experience** â†’ Immediate answers mean fewer frustrated renters.  
- **Higher Conversion Rates** â†’ Prospective tenants get clarity fast.
